GeoProjects with Geoformat
==========================

Wordpress Theme for managing maps and markers through projects.

This theme uses [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) library for controlling the maps, and by default, uses [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org) as tiles provider.

It's coded in HTML5 / CSS3, uses [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) and is fully responsive.

It integrates Infinitescroll.js for a lazy loading of the index pages, Masonry when blocks are called, and UISearch from Codrops for a practical and dynamic search bar.

The icon library used is the fabulous Ionicons. The theme is customizable with a selection of Google Fonts.

It includes, as well, a toolbox partly based on the KnightLab tools for journalistic storytelling.
